I am a political scientist focused on poverty and inequality, currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Washington University in St. Louis. I received my PhD in Political Science from University of California, San Diego in 2017.

I use new computational methods such as automated text analysis to study economic and racial inequality and the intersection between the two in the United States. I am broadly interested in the politics of inequality, race and ethnic politics, voting rights, urban segregation, political communication, and computational social science. 

I am dedicated to understanding the consequences of American inequality and using political science to better inform solutions.
